## Breaking Changes

#### Removed IamPolicyLambdaExecution Resource

We've removed the `IamPolicyLambdaExecution` resource template and replaced it with inline policy within the role as it's been causing issues with VPC and bloating the CF template. This is a breaking change only for users who are depending on that resource with `Ref` or similar CF intrinsic functions.

#### Changed displayed function name for `sls info`

The function name displayed when you run `sls info` is now the short function name as found in `serverless.yml` rather than the actual lambda name to keep it more provider agnostic. This could be breaking for any user who is depending or parsing the CLI output.

## Meta

- [Comparison since last release](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/compare/v1.6.1...v1.7.0)

# 1.6.1 (2017-01-31)

A minimal patch release that fixes an issue with rendering README.md on npm registry.

# 1.6.0 (2017-01-30)

**Important Note:** This release includes breaking changes. If your services stopped working after upgrading to v1.6.0, please read the following section.

## Breaking Changes

### CloudWatch logs are created explicitly

Up until this release, CloudWatch log groups were created implicitly by AWS/Lambda by default and were not included in your service stack. However, some users were able to easily reach the CloudWatch log group limits (currently at 500 log groups), and it wasn't an easy task to clear them all. Because of that we decided to explicitly create the log groups using CloudFormation so that you can easily remove them with `sls remove`. This was also optionally possible with the `cfLogs: true` config option.

If your service doesn't have the `cfLogs: true` set, and one of the function has been invoked at least once (hence the log groups were created implicitly by AWS), then it's very likely that you'll receive a "log group already exists" error after upgrading to v1.6.0. That's because CF is now trying to create the already created log groups from scratch to include it in the stack resources. **To fix this breaking change,** simply delete the old log group, or rename your service if you **must** keep the old logs.

### Removed function Arns from CloudFormation outputs

Up until this release, the output section of the generated CloudFormation template included an output resource for each function Arn. This caused deploying big services to fail because users were hitting the 60 outputs per stack limit. This effectively means that you can't have a service that has more than 60 functions. To avoid this AWS limit, we decided to remove those function output resources completely, to keep the stack clean. This also means removing the function Arns from the `sls info` command, and at the end of the deployment command.

This is a breaking change for your project if you're depending on those function output resources in anyway, or if you're depending on function arn outputs from the deploy or info commands. Otherwise, your project shouldn't be affected by this change. Fixing this issue depends on your needs, but just remember that you can always create your own CF outputs in `serverless.yml`.

### Moved `getStackName()` method

This is a breaking change for plugin authors only. If your plugin used the `provider.getStackName()` method, it has been moved to `naming.js`, and should be referenced with `provider.naming.getStackName()` instead.

### Removed the `defaults` property from `serverless.yml`

We've finally dropped support for the `defaults` property which we introduced in v1. All child properties should now be moved to the `provider` object instead.

# 1.1.0 (2016-11-02)

## Future breaking changes

We will include the LogGroup for your Lambda function in the CloudFormation template in the future. This will break deployments to existing applications because the log group was already created. You will get a warning about this if you deploy currently. We will force this behaviour in a future release, for now you can set it through the `cfLogs: true` parameter in your provider config. This change will also limit the logging rights to only this LogGroup, which should have no impact on your environment. You can read more in [our docs](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/functions#log-group-resources).

- [Rollback Support](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/rollback/) (#2495)

Accidentally released 1.0.1 to NPM, so we have to skip this version (added here to remove confusion)

# 1.0.0 (2016-10-12)

## Breaking Changes

- The HTTP Event now uses the [recently released Lambda Proxy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-set-up-simple-proxy.html#api-gateway-proxy-integration-types) by default. This requires you to change your handler result to fit the new proxy integration. You can also switch back to the old integration type.
- The Cloudformation Name of APIG paths that have a variable have changed, so if you have a variable in a path and redeploy CF will throw an error. To fix this remove the path and readd it a second deployment.

## Release Highlights

Following is a selection of the most important Features of the 1.0.0 since 1.0.0-rc.1.
