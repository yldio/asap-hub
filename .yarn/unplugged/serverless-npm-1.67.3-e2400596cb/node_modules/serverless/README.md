**The Serverless Framework** – Build applications comprised of microservices that run in response to events, auto-scale for you, and only charge you when they run. This lowers the total cost of maintaining your apps, enabling you to build more logic, faster.

The Framework uses new event-driven compute services, like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and more. It's a command-line tool, providing scaffolding, workflow automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture. It's also completely extensible via plugins.

Serverless is an MIT open-source project, actively maintained by a full-time, venture-backed team.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nf0ui3qP2E" target="_blank">Watch the video overview here.</a>

In 2020, the Serverless Framework began introducing advanced functionality for specific serverless use-cases, known as Serverless Framework Components.  Check out the Components featured below, [and more here](https://github.com/serverless-components).

## <a name="quick-start"></a>Quick Start

[Watch the video guide here](https://serverless.com/framework/) or follow the steps below to create and deploy your first serverless microservice in minutes.

1. **Install via npm:**

```bash
npm install -g serverless
```

2. **Set-up your [Provider Credentials](./docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials.md)**. [Watch the video on setting up credentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSd9uYj2LJA)

3. **Create a Service:**

You can create a new service or [install existing services](#how-to-install-a-service).

```bash
# Create a new Serverless Service/Project
serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path my-service
# Change into the newly created directory
cd my-service
```

4. **Deploy a Service:**

Use this when you have made changes to your Functions, Events or Resources in `serverless.yml` or you simply want to deploy all changes within your Service at the same time.

```bash
serverless deploy -v
```

5. **Deploy the Function:**

Use this to quickly upload and overwrite your AWS Lambda code on AWS, allowing you to develop faster.

```bash
serverless deploy function -f hello
```

6. **Invoke the Function on AWS:**

Invokes an AWS Lambda Function on AWS and returns logs.

```bash
serverless invoke -f hello -l
```

7. **Invoke the Function on your machine:**

Invokes an AWS Lambda Function on your local machine and returns logs.

```bash
serverless invoke local -f hello -l
```

8. **Fetch the Function Logs:**

Open up a separate tab in your console and stream all logs for a specific Function using this command.

```bash
serverless logs -f hello -t
```

9. **Remove the Service:**

Removes all Functions, Events and Resources from your AWS account.

```bash
serverless remove
```

### How to Install a Service:

This is a convenience method to install a pre-made Serverless Service locally by downloading the Github repo and unzipping it. Services are listed below.

```bash
serverless install -u https://github.com/your-url-to-the-serverless-service
```

Check out the [Serverless Framework Guide](./docs/providers/aws/guide/README.md) for more information.
