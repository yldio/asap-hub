# asap-hub

> The monorepo for the backend, frontend, and infrastructure of the [ASAP](https://parkinsonsroadmap.org/) hub

[![Pipeline development and production](https://github.com/yldio/asap-hub/actions/workflows/on-push-master.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yldio/asap-hub/actions/workflows/on-push-master.yml)

## Requirements

### Node.js

To work on this repository, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. We are using the version specified in the [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) file. If you use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), running `nvm use` in the repo root will switch to the right version automatically. If you use [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/) set up with the `nodejs` module, running `asdf install` will do the same.

### Yarn

You need to have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. Any recent version (>=1.22) will automatically detect our local Yarn version and use that, so your exact version does not matter.
The [zero-install strategy](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs) means that you do not need to run `yarn` after checking out the repository, all of the scripts will just work™.

IDEs require special configuration for TypeScript to work when using Plug'n'Play installs.

- [vscode](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks#vscode)
- [vim](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks#vim)

#### Emacs

- [instructions (see below)](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks#emacs)

The `.dir-locals.el` configuration file has already been created in the repository, so you just need to run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```sh
yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks base
```

## Repo structure

This repository consists of packages and apps along with their tests inside the individual folders inside `/packages` and `/apps`. Packages are meant for consumption by other packages or apps, while apps are not depended on by other packages or apps but instead have build artifacts like a website bundle to be served by a web server, or a JavaScript application to be run by a Node.js process.

## Scripts

This is a list of the scripts that you will commonly need to run locally in the repo root and their descriptions.
For a full list of root scripts, look inside [`package.json`](package.json).
For a list of individual package and particularly app scripts, look inside the readme file or `package.json` of the individual package or app.

- `yarn build` - This will typecheck and build all packages and apps in the repository. You may want to run this e.g. after checking out a branch.
- `yarn watch:babel` - This will watch all the packages (but not apps) for changes and whenever changes occur, build them, so that other packages and apps can use the changes.
- `yarn watch:typecheck` - This will watch all the packages (but not apps) for changes and whenever changes occur, typecheck them and emit new type definitions, so that other packages and apps can see the new module type signature.
- `yarn fix:format` - This will reformat all files in the repository to match our formatting standards using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
- `yarn test` - This will lint and test all packages and apps in the repository. You may want to run this with `--watch` or other [Jest CLI options](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli.html).
- `yarn test:integration` - Runs the integration tests for the API against Contentful.
- `yarn test:*` - There are further test configurations being run on CI that are usually slower or more specific and thus not suitable to run during day-to-day development. You can execute those scripts manually. Some of them may require installing native modules via `yarn rebuild` first.
- `yarn lint` - this will run the linting for the project. A `yarn build:typecheck` is a prerequisite.

## Setting up your development environment

For you, a newcomer, to be running your development setup, you'll need to complete the following steps:

### Create a new user on Contentful

- Log in to <https://www.contentful.com/>
- You will need to be added to the "YLD ASAP > CRN Hub" or "YLD ASAP > GP2" app if you don't already have access
- In th environment selector in the top left, select `Development` (or `Production` if required)
- In the "Content" section, create a new `User` content model with your email address
- If you use an `@yld.io` email address for the user then you should receive an invitation email, and you can follow th instructions from the email
- If you do not receive an invitation email then you can copy the value which should be populated in the `Connections` field on the user, and visit <https://dev.hub.asap.science/welcome/{invitation-code}> with the invitation code replaced with the value from Contentful

To send a new invitation you can remove the values from the `Connections` field.

### Get everything running

- create a `.env` file and update it with the necessary details (ask one of the engineers for a working config, there is a `.env.example` file to work from, but you'll need the details)
- You can run all apps in the project with a simple `yarn start` on the project's root. It will load up everything, but you don't need to run everything. Depending on what you're doing, you only need some apps up
- `yarn watch:babel`: to have babel watching and compiling for you (you'll need this running most of the time)
- `yarn watch:typecheck`: well... for types checking (you'll need this running most of the time)
- `yarn watch`: to have babel and type checking watching and compiling for you
- `yarn start:backend:crn`: to run the CRN backend
- `yarn start:frontend:crn`: to run the CRN frontend
- `yarn start:backend:gp2`: to run the GP2 backend
- `yarn start:frontend:gp2`: to run the GP2 frontend
- `yarn start:storybook`: to run storybook
- `yarn start:crn` - to run both the CRN backend and frontend
- `yarn start:gp2` - to run both the GP2 backend and frontend
- `yarn start`: to run all of the above

### Now that everything's up

- On <http://localhost:3000> you should have the CRN hub running
- On <http://localhost:4000> you should have the GP2 hub running
- You should be able to log in to the relevant app using the user you created above

### Contentful Dedicated Environment

If you require a dedicated environment for your development work, create a PR and add one or both of the following labels to your PR. This will run the github action workflow to create a new environment in contentful.
This will also create a duplication of the algolia entity index for you to use during the development.

- crn-create-environment
- gp2-create-environment

You should create a dedicated environment in Contentful if:

- you are making any changes to the content models in Contentful
- you need to develop/test webhook behaviour as part of your PR

When creating a new Contentful environment you will need to ensure that the API keys you are using for local development have permission to access that environment. You can check this by inspecting your API key settings at <https://app.contentful.com/spaces/5v6w5j61tndm/environments/master/api/keys>.

### Analytics Algolia Dedicated Environment

If you require a dedicated environment for your development work, create a PR and add the following label to it.
This will run the github action workflow to create a new environment with a copy of the relevant Analytics Algolia indexes.

- crn-create-analytics-algolia-index

To avoid incurring in extra costs you should only use this if you need to make changes in Analytics indexes and make sure they are deleted when you close/merge your PR.

### Update Postmark templates

If you need to create or update templates on Postmark you can have your branch deploying your changes to Postmarks Branch server. For that you'll need to add the following label to your PR:

- postmark-templates-update

Note: this DOES NOT create a dedicated server. The same server will be used if there are multiple branches using it.

## Editor setup

Refer to [this Yarn documentation page](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/editor-sdks) for how to integrate your editor with the TypeScript compiler and ESLint linter in this repository. You will also need to set up your editor to run ESLint with the same CLI options that the scripts do — they are in [this file](jest-runner-eslint.config.js).

## Further documentation

Individual `packages` or `apps` may contain their own readme files as deemed necessary.
The [`docs`](docs) folder contains overall architecture / decision documentation.

## Contentful

### Schema changes and graphql

The graphql schema, and associated types are generated automatically by Contentful. When you make changes to graphql queries, or to the content models in Contentful you will need to regenerate the schema documents. You can do this by running the following command:

```sh
yarn contentful:schema:update

# or for CRN or GP2 individually
yarn contentful:schema:update:crn
yarn contentful:schema:update:gp2
```

Then commit the changed files.

### Backup

There is a GitHub Actions workflow to backup and restore Contentful data.

Backups are done twice a day for production and once a day for dev. You can trigger a data restoration from the action menu ([click here](https://github.com/yldio/asap-hub/actions/workflows/on-demand-contentful-restore.yml)). This can be done using production or development data and target custom environments.

- [on-schedule-backup-prod.yml](./.github/workflows/on-schedule-backup-prod.yml) to backup from prod
- [on-schedule-backup-dev.yml](./.github/workflows/on-schedule-backup-dev.yml) to backup from dev
- [on-demand-contentful-restore.yml](./.github/workflows/on-demand-contentful-restore.yml) to restore backup data.

### Migrations

In order to support the migration from Squidex to Contentful, we've set up a migration system which allows us to track our changes on a per-content type basis, and preserve the history. This is done using [contentful-migrate](https://github.com/deluan/contentful-migrate), a thin third-party wrapper around the official [contentful-migration](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-migration) tool.

#### Creating a New Migration

Once you've completed the steps above, you can create a new migration file with:

```sh
   MIGRATION_TYPE=<content_type> MIGRATION_NAME=<name> yarn contentful:migration:create:<app_name>
```

So if you wanted to add a `foo` field to the `bar` content type:

```sh
   MIGRATION_TYPE=bar MIGRATION_NAME=add-foo-field yarn contentful:migration:create:crn
```

Note: the `content_type` is the slug, not the display name, so `externalAuthors` not `External Authors`.

#### Generating the migration with a script

The same way we can make changes in Squidex UI and sync them with our local schemas, it's possible to create a new content type or modify an existing one and generate the migration, so you don't need to type all fields you want to include or remove from the content type.

This is possible using the `space generate migration` command from Contentful CLI. Reference: https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli/tree/master/docs/space/generate/migration.

So, if you want to create or modify a content type using the approach above, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create manually a new environment
   1. Access https://app.contentful.com/spaces/5v6w5j61tndm/environments/master/settings/environments
   2. Click Add environment button
   3. Give it a name and clone the new environment from Production
2. Access the environment you created in step 1 and make the changes you want in the content type
3. Adjust your `.env` file with `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID` being `5v6w5j61tndm` and `CONTENTFUL_ENV_ID` being the name you gave to your environment in step `1.3`.
4. Run the script to generate the migration

   ```sh
   MIGRATION_TYPE=media yarn contentful:migration:generate:gp2
   ```

   This will generate a file with the `up` part of the migration. Be aware that you might need to edit a few things. For example, if you are editing an existing content model, you will have to change `createContentType` to `editContentType` in the generated migration.

5. Remember to delete this environment after you finish your PR.

#### Initiating an Environment

_Note: This is not something you will need to do regularly, I have documented it for the rare case where you are creating a new environment from scratch and not cloning one which is already using migrations._

The following command will create the migration content schema:

```sh
yarn workspace @asap-hub/contentful ctf-migrate init
```

#### Counting Migrations to be Run

If you want to know the number of migrations which have not yet been applied to the target environment:

```sh
yarn contentful:migration:count:crn
yarn contentful:migration:count:gp2
```

#### Running Migrations

To run outstanding migrations, first do a dry run:

```sh
yarn contentful:migration:dryrun:crn
yarn contentful:migration:dryrun:gp2
```

If all looks good, repeat with the commands.

```sh
yarn contentful:migration:run:crn
yarn contentful:migration:run:gp2
```

There are also convenience methods for this:

- `yarn workspace @asap-hub/contentful space:migrate:crn:dryrun`
- `yarn workspace @asap-hub/contentful space:migrate:crn`

#### Rolling back a Migration

Rollbacks are per-content type, and can be used like this:

```sh
CONTENTFUL_MIGRATIONS_DIR=migrations/crn yarn ctf-migrate down -c <content_type> --dry-run
```

Then repeat the command without `--dry-run` if all looks good.

## Docker Images

### Image name

The current image tag in use is: 86a189edc900d4e1afdcf3935c697292f69d409b

### Build new image

The docker images are built using a GitHub Action workflow - build-images.yml.

If manually trigger, this will build the images defined in the Dockerfile and are pushed to the GitHub Container registry with the following tags:

- latest
- SHA of the commit

images available:

node-python-sq

These are currently set to build only on master, and the images used in the
GitHub workflows are fixed to the SHA.

To build new images:

- Update build-images.yml to build from the current branch and not master.
- Update the Dockerfile and push the changes.

To change the image tag, run:

```sh
  gsed -i s/86a189edc900d4e1afdcf3935c697292f69d409b/some-new-tag/g .github/**/*.yml README.md
```

## Manage GitHub workflow runs logs

To remove logs:

- List the workflow runs:

```sh
sh .github/scripts/manage-workflows/list-workflows.sh
```

- Find the Id of the workflow to delete.

```text
"Pipeline Test"
21969391
".github/workflows/single-pipeline.yml"
```

- use the Id to delete the workflow runs:

```sh
  sh .github/scripts/manage-workflows/delete-workflow-runs.sh 21969391
```
