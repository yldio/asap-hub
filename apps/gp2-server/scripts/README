## User import

To run the import script use this command from the root of this repository:

```bash
yarn import:users <file-path>
```

Where `<file-path>` is a relative path to the CSV file.

To import users into the correct environment make sure to set the following environment variables:
```
SQUIDEX_CLIENT_ID
SQUIDEX_CLIENT_SECRET
SQUIDEX_APP_NAME
SQUIDEX_BASE_URL
```
