We will first quantify the motor function of A53T human α-synuclein Tg mice and age-matched non-transgenic littermates using a modified open field test. To evaluate whether changes of dynein were related to α-synuclein aggregation, double immunostaining for α-synuclein and dynein will be performed. Finally, an analysis of the correlation between motor behaviors and the protein level of dynein in the striatum will be conducted.',
